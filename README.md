# Tip-jar
## Problem
Imagine we have an app as seen in the following link 
[Design](https://www.figma.com/file/Wjc3WG4kH8IFooV2DLv29v/TipJar?node-id=0%3A1).
The user now wants to be able to store and retrieve their payment history from our server. To solve this problem we 
need to build an API that supports the following operations.

* Save payment history item
* Get latest payment history item
* Get all payment history items

These endpoints need some kind of database to store the payments, so we can retrieve them later.

## What to do?
You are supposed to design and implement a system that covers these API endpoints. We expect the code to be 
built in a manner that makes it easy to write tests and maintain.

We expect you to take full advantage of spring framework and show us that you are comfortable using it.

## Requirements
* Use Spring framework
* Code is buildable and able to run in tests
* Include a diagram over the solution
* Database table structure

## Nice to have
* Utilize reactive frameworks (RxJava, Reactor)
